# Commit Types:
# 
# feat:      A new feature
# fix:       A bug fix
# refactor:  A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# style:     Changes that do not affect behavior (formatting, missing semicolons)
# docs:      Documentation-only changes
# test:      Adding or updating tests without affecting production code
# chore:     Maintenance tasks (build scripts, tooling, dependencies)
# wip:       Work-in-progress (local only, must be squashed before merge)

# Important:
# - Separate subject from body with a blank line.
# - Write in imperative mood ("Add" not "Added" or "Adds").
# - Do not end the subject line with a period.
# - Use wip commits only locally â€” squash before merging shared branches.
